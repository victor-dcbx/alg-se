## Victor's SE assignement

Please find in this repository my assignment answers for the [Solution Engineering recruiting challenge](https://github.com/algolia/solutions-hiring-assignment).

You can find the answers for the communication project by following [this link](https://github.com/victor-dcbx/alg-se/blob/master/resources/answers.txt).

The script I used to consolidate the dataset [can be found here](https://github.com/victor-dcbx/alg-se/blob/master/resources/dataset/consolidate.js).

Most of the logic behind the app lives under the [/src directory](https://github.com/victor-dcbx/alg-se/tree/master/src)

And of course, feel free to test the end-result of my coding challenge at this url: https://algolia-se.herokuapp.com/
